### Bookings resource

#### Getting all the bookings
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/bookings
```

#### Creating bookings
Since the bookings must be added to a certain campsite, they are actually created on the campsites resource...

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/campsites/{campsite_id}/bookings
```
Where {campsite_id} is the id of the campsite where the booking should be created

Example body:
```json
{
        "fullName": "Another One",
        "email": "dusty@somedomain.com",
        "checkInDateTime": "2019-02-22T12:00:00",
        "checkoutDateTime": "2019-02-24T12:00:00"
}
```

A variety of results is returned depending on the outcame

```
Error code 500
```
```json
["Booking should be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance"]
```
```json
["Bookings can't be for more than 3 days"]
```
```json
["The date you provided is not available for booking"]
```

On a sucessfull result (so the booking is confirmed), an HTTP 200 ok result is returned and in the body of the response the booking id which will be used for managing porpouses later.

#### Modifying bookings
```
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/campsites/1/bookings/{id}
```
Where *{id}* is the id provided on the sucessful response when creating the booking

Example body:
```json
{
        "fullName": "Another modified One",
        "email": "dusty@somedomain.com",
        "checkInDateTime": "2019-02-28T12:00:00",
        "checkoutDateTime": "2019-03-02T12:00:00"
}
```
#### Deleting bookings
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/campsites/1/bookings/{id}
```
Where *{id}* is the id provided on the sucessful response when creating the booking

On suscessful DELETE, a 200 (ok) Status Code will be returned, on Error a 500 Internal server Error and finally, if the indicated id doesn't exist, a 404 Not found will be returned.
